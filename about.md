### In Short
I'm someone who loves exploring both the online world and nature. I'm an INFJ-A, meaning I like to think deeply and use my intuition to turn ideas into reality. 

### A Little More

I enjoy spending time both outdoors in nature and inside working on computers. I've learned a lot from different experiences, from working at my uncle's carpentry workshop to sewing beds at a local market.

Here's what keeps me inspired:
- My Spotify playlist shows what music means to me. [Here its link](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2N1n0vP0bRWK8SxhEzNcWv?si=1945a43500664dd7)
- I listen to **My First Million** podcast to keep my business flames burning.
- **Mafia I and II** had a great impact on me; because of it I fell in love with the 30's, and 40's music.
- **Outliers** by Malcolm Gladwell changed how I view Success.
- These are the YouTube channels I like:
    - [FireShip](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship)
    - [Y Combinator](https://www.youtube.com/@ycombinator)
    - [James Jani](https://www.youtube.com/@JamesJani)
    - [Oliver Knill](https://www.youtube.com/@OliverKnill)
    - [Garry Tan](https://www.youtube.com/@GarryTan)

**The Blind Side:** I don't know why I loved this movie so much, maybe because I share some common things with the main character.

I'm always up for making new connections, so feel free to contact me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
