### In Short
I'm someone who loves exploring both the online world and nature. I'm an INFJ-A, meaning I like to think deeply and use my intuition to turn ideas into reality. I love talking to cats in the morning and working on business ideas during the day.

### A Little More

I enjoy spending time both outdoors in nature and inside working on computers, ever since the early days of the internet. I've learned a lot from different experiences, like working at a local market and helping in my uncle's workshop.

I'm a highly sensitive person (HSP), which helps me in thinking deeply and feeling intensely about business and technology. As an INFJ-A, I'm all about making meaningful paths and achieving goals that matter.

Here's what keeps me inspired:
- My Spotify playlist shows what music means to me. [Here its link](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2N1n0vP0bRWK8SxhEzNcWv?si=1945a43500664dd7)
- I listen to the **My First Million** podcast to keep my business flames burning.
- I relax with **Mafia I and II** games for a mix of story and nostalgia.
- The book **Outliers** by Malcolm Gladwell changed the way I think.
- I watch a variety of YouTube channels to keep learning and stay curious:
    - [FireShip](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship)
    - [Y Combinator](https://www.youtube.com/@ycombinator)
    - [James Jani](https://www.youtube.com/@JamesJani)
    - [Oliver Knill](https://www.youtube.com/@OliverKnill)
    - [Garry Tan](https://www.youtube.com/@GarryTan)

And for me, **The Great Gatsby** movie really shows what ambition and dreams are all about.

That's a bit about me. I'm always up for making new connections, so feel free to contact me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
